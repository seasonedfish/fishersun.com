                I'm Fisher. I'm a CS student that loves learning about all things software and software engineering.

                I'm most experienced with desktop app development and data analysis with Python.
                Recently, I've been getting into TypeScript for web apps and Rust for CLIs.

                On this website, you find <a href="/blog">my blog</a>, where from time to time I'll post articles about interesting things that I learned, or cool things that I worked on.
