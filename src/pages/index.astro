        <h2>What's new</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>7/13/2024: You may now comment on my posts. Actually, don't get your hopes up too much: I've only implemented a button that opens your email client with the subject filled in. But hopefully this will reduce the effort of commenting! I've also made some minor improvements to the site's visuals; inline code and code blocks have a nicer background now, and numbers are lining now.</li>
