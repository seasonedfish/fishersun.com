name: "CMake Independent Study"

When I took CSE 332S at WashU (Object-Oriented Software Development Laboratory), I was frustrated that because I didn't own a Windows computer, I had to use the sluggish remote desktop to work on the course's C++ assignments. The next semester, I did an independent study to migrate the course studios and labs to CMake, allowing students to develop on any platform.

Although perhaps not my most eye-catching work,
it may be my most appreciated; many students have thanked me because they were glad they didn't have to use the remote desktop anymore.
