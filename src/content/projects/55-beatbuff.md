name: "Beatbuff"

In a team of three, I built Beatbuff, a website for music album reviews. Users of the site can rate any album on Spotify, plus follow their friends to see what albums they recommend. There's also a notification system that allows users to see when they get a new follower and when someone comments on their reviews.

To build Beatbuff, we used Next.js and TypeScript.
For our database, we used Prisma and MySQL; for the frontend, we used Chakra UI and Tailwind.
