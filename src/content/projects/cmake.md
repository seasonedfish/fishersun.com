name: "CMake Independent Study"

When I took CSE 332S at WashU (Object-Oriented Software Development Laboratory), I was frustrated that because I didn't own a Windows computer, I had to use the sluggish remote desktop to work on the course's C++ assignments. The next semester, I did an independent study to migrate the course studios and labs to CMake, allowing students to develop on any platform.
