Alongside Noah Cunningham Baker and Adam Kirsch, I built Beatbuff, a website for music album reviews. Users of the site can rate any album on Spotify, plus follow their friends to see what albums they recommend. There's also a notification system that allows users to see when they get a new follower and when someone comments on their reviews.
