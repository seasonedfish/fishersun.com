Yesterday, I migrated this site from Astro v4 to Astro v5 to make use of the experimental [SVG components](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/experimental-flags/svg/).

I followed the [update guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/upgrade-to/v5/).
It seemed like all I needed to do was change the collections code to work with the new Content Layer API.

All was going well with the Content Layer API in dev mode, so I ran `astro build`:

```console
$ pnpm build

Strange, no type errors, but it's breaking? Ctrl-Fing through the upgrade guide for "Image" found nothing related.
And neither searching Google nor searching Astro's issues for this error message yielded any helpful information.

It was by looking through all my project occurrences of "Image" that I finally found the issue.

In one of my components, I had imported `Image` with:
```ts
import Image from "astro/components/Image.astro"
```
The Image component does in fact live inside `astro/components`, but it's [exposed](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/817fe553899d0a8a0e4ff27c8d062bf1e24ca566/packages/astro/src/assets/vite-plugin-assets.ts#L123) by `astro:assets`,
and official documentation for both v4 and v5 say to  import Image from `astro:assets` instead of directly.

So, the import should have been:
```ts
import { Image } from "astro:assets"
```

Changing this resulted in the build succeeding.

Doing a [code search](https://github.com/search?type=code&q=astro%2Fcomponents%2FImage.astro) on the direct import statement shows hundreds of repos that make the same mistake.

![GitHub code search of the problematic import statement, showing 1.9k code matches](search.png)

I suspect that many people will be affected by this when they upgrade their sites from v4 to v5. Thus, I wrote this blog post; I hope it's helpful to people that get tripped up by this in the future.
